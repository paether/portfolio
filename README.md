My portfolio website which consists high-level details about me and my projects. My focus was to achieve a minimal but modern style on the website with an ease of access which also highlights my main capabilites at the moment of creation.

## Features / Challanges

- Used the mobile first methodology when started building out the layout / design of the site.
- Focued heavily on advanced CSS transitions / animations with the help of pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes.
- Custom domain and forced SSL to the site which was a nice addition to my skills.
- Optimizing the site's performance by using chrome's Lighthouse features and recommendations (first versions of the site included too performance heavy transitions / animations.)

## Technologies used:

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML5 / CSS
- Express
