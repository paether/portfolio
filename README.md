<h1>My Portfolio website </h1>

Main takeaways of the project:

- Used the mobile first methodology when started building out the layout / design of the site.
- Focued heavily on advanced CSS transitions / animations with the help of pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes.
- Practiced how to configure a custom domain and add SSL to the site.
- Optimizing the site's performance by using chrome's Lighthouse features and recommendations.
  This was needed to prevent me from using too performance heavy transitions / animations.

Technologies used:

- React
- Javascript
- HTML5 / CSS
- Express
